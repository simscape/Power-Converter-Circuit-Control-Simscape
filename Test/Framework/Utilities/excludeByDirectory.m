function filtered = excludeByDirectory(paths, directories, projectRoot)
% excludeByDirectory - Removes file paths under specified directories relative to project root
%
% Filters a list of file paths by checking whether each file resides under
% any of the specified directories. Each directory entry is a path relative
% to the project root.
%
% This function is used during Phase 2 (Exclusion) of the file discovery
% pipeline in TestFileDiscovery. It applies to the unified candidate list
% after IncludeDirectories and IncludeFiles have been merged, so
% exclusion rules always take precedence over inclusion.
%
% Each entry in directories is resolved to an absolute path:
%   fullfile(projectRoot, directories(i))
% A file is excluded if its absolute path starts with any resolved directory
% path followed by a file separator. All files under that
% folder, including all subfolders, are excluded.
%
% Matching is case-sensitive. Directory paths must be specified with the
% exact case as they appear on the file system.
%
% Syntax: filtered = excludeByDirectory(paths, directories, projectRoot)
%
% Inputs:
%   paths       - (:,1) string array of absolute file paths to filter
%   directories - (:,1) string array of directory paths relative to project
%                 root to exclude (for example, "Workflow", "Components/archive")
%   projectRoot - string, absolute path to the project root
%
% Output:
%   filtered - (:,1) string array of paths with excluded directories removed
%
% Examples:
%   % Exclude all files under <ProjectRoot>/Workflow/
%   filtered = excludeByDirectory(paths, "Workflow", "C:\project")
%
%   % Exclude files under multiple directories
%   filtered = excludeByDirectory(paths, ["Components/archive"; "Test"], "C:\project")
